  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
- **Docker**:
  ```bash
  docker --version
  docker compose version
  ```
- **Laravel**:
  ```bash
  laravel --version
  ```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **System Compatibility**: These scripts are designed for Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. For other operating systems, you may need to modify the scripts.
2. **Customization**: You can specify the versions of tools and frameworks to install by editing the version variables in the scripts.
3. **Reboot/Logout**: After running some scripts (e.g., Docker installation), you may need to log out and log back in or reboot for changes to take effect.

### **How to Use the File Structure**

- Each subdirectory (e.g., `languages/`, `frameworks/`) organizes scripts by type for clarity and scalability.
- This structure ensures easy navigation, even as more scripts are added over time.
- You can further expand the categories or create new ones (e.g., `CI-CD/` for continuous integration tools) as needed.

Let me know if you’d like further refinements!
